SRPMultiplier

Changes some stuff in SRParasites to work better with RLCraft

Changes:
- Global Multipliers for Health, Armor, Damage and KB Resistance are set per dimension (default is 1x for overworld, 2x for nether+end, 4x for LC)
- LC starts in Phase 8, Stage 4 Beckons and Stage 3 Dispatchers spawn naturally, Lures are disabled and turn to Dispatcher Nidus when trying to use them
- Bloody Clock also shows the progress to next phase in %
- Parasite Spawners in LC buildings work
- Plays respective sounds when dispatchers or beckons of higher stages naturally spawn

Idea is that LC is overrun by parasites and now they spill over to the other dimensions. If you try to enter LC, theres gonna be parasitic biomes almost immediately
